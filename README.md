Fictitious Test Solution

Following are the changes I would make to the solution:-

1. Setup Carthage and use appropriate libraries.

2. If third party libraries are not allowed, create a Static Library called 'CakeWebService' with CakeDataService & CakeImageService classes that provide methods for specific requests. 

3. Implement Unit tests & xctests

4. Prefer to write all this in Swift using Protocol Oriented Programming following MVVM design pattern with FRP.
